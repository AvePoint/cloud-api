Endpoints Upon Data Center Note Effective April 2025 release, AvePoint Online Services commercial production environment now supports the following Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data centers: GCP for Australia Southeast (Sydney) GCP for Japan (Tokyo) GCP for East US (Moncks Corner) GCP for West Europe (Eemshaven, Netherlands) GCP for South Korea (Seoul) These GCP data centers are currently deployed with the following AvePoint services: AvePoint Online Services Cloud Backup for Microsoft 365 Cloud Backup for Google Workspace AvePoint Opus Insights In addition to the core deployments, the public APIs for these products now fully support GCP data center endpoints. Refer to the data center endpoints in the table below: Infrastructure Region URL Microsoft Azure APAC - Australia https://graph-au.avepointonlineservices.com/ APAC - Singapore https://graph-sg.avepointonlineservices.com/ Canada Central (Toronto) https://graph-ca.avepointonlineservices.com/ EMEA - Ireland https://graph-ne.avepointonlineservices.com/ EMEA - Netherlands https://graph-we.avepointonlineservices.com/ France Central (Paris) https://graph-fr.avepointonlineservices.com/ Germany West Central (Frankfurt) https://graph-de.avepointonlineservices.com/ Japan West - Osaka https://graph-jp.avepointonlineservices.com/ Korea Central (Seoul) https://graph-kr.avepointonlineservices.com/ Switzerland North (Zurich) https://graph-ch.avepointonlineservices.com/ UK South (London) https://graph-uk.avepointonlineservices.com/ US - East https://graph-us.avepointonlineservices.com/ AOS-US Gov https://graph-gov.avepointonlineservices.com/ Google Cloud Platform Australia Southeast (Sydney):australia-southeast1 https://graph-gcp-au.avepointonlineservices.com/ Japan (Tokyo):asia-northeast1 https://graph-gcp-jp.avepointonlineservices.com/ East US (Moncks Corner):us-east1 https://graph-gcp-us.avepointonlineservices.com/ West Europe (Eemshaven, Netherlands):europe-west4 https://graph-gcp-we.avepointonlineservices.com/ South Korea (Seoul): asia-northeast3 https://graph-gcp-kr.avepointonlineservices.com/ Security Measures Authentication Method (OAuth 2.0) AvePoint Graph API exclusively uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. This industry-standard framework ensures secure delegated access to resources. Applications must authenticate via the app registered through AOS App registration to obtain OAuth 2.0 access tokens, which grant scoped permissions for interacting with Graph API endpoints. This process prevents unauthorized access by validating identities and enforcing least-privilege principles. TLS Requirements: TLS 1.2/1.3 All connections to AvePoint Graph API endpoints must use Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3. Earlier versions (TLS 1.0/1.1) are explicitly disabled and non-compliant. This ensures end-to-end encryption for data in transit, protecting against eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Applications failing to negotiate TLS 1.2+ connections will be blocked. Certificates and Client Secret Specifications AvePoint recommends that you set an expiration for the secrets of one year for the app registration, and the secrets are hashed using SHA-256 before storing to AvePoint's secure backend system. Certificate-based authentication For enhanced security, use X.509 certificate instead of client secretes. The certificate must contain a public key, and you must have access to the corresponding private key. The \"Key Usage\" extension of the certificate must be marked for Digital Signature."

    "href": "docs/register-app.html",
    "title": "Register an App for API Access",
    "summary": "Register an App for API Access To register an app for the AvePoint Graph API, follow these steps: Access AvePoint Online Services Sign into AvePoint Online Services with your account. For details, refer to Sign into AvePoint Online Services. Navigate to Administration > App registrations. Register a New App with Required Permissions: Click Create on the App registrations page. On the Create app registration page, enter a name for the app. Click Add service and permission. In the Add service and permission pane, select the services and corresponding permissions that you need to grant to this app, and then click Add. Note For the services and permissions that you can grant to the app for using Graph API, refer to Services and Permissions. Use a certificate or client secret as the app credentials. Credentials enable application to identify themselves to the authentication service when receiving tokens at a web addressable location (using an HTTPS schema). For a higher level of assurance, we recommend using a certificate. Follow the instructions below to configure credentials: The certificate serves as credentials that allow your application to authenticate itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime. Refer to Prepare a Certificate for the Custom Azure App section in AvePoint Online Services user guide to prepare a certificate. If you choose to use the client secret, you can generate a client secret effective within 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years. Client secret values cannot be entirely shown once they are saved. Obtain Application (Client) ID After you have created the app registration, you can click the Copy button to copy the Application (client) ID value which will be used to get an access token in the next step. Get access token: Based on the credentials of your app registration, refer to the following instructions to get an access token: Use Client Secret: You need to send a POST request with the client ID, client secret, scope, and grant type. See the request and response samples in the linked section. Use Certificate. You need to generate a JWT signed with your certificate and send a POST request with the client ID, client assertion (the signed JWT), scope, and grant type. See the DotNet example in the linked section. Use the access token to call an API. For example, you can use the GET request to retrieve the audit records within a specific time range using the access token: GET https://graph-us.avepointonlineservices.com/aos/audit?startTime=2023-03-01T08:00:00Z&endTime=2023-03-02T08:00:00Z Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN Services and Permissions See the table below for the services and permissions that can be used for accessing API: AvePoint Cloud Service Permission Usage AvePoint Online Services audit.read.all Get the audit records of activities in your AvePoint Online Services tenant.

    "title": "Register an App for API Access",
    "summary": "Register an App for API Access Complete the following steps to register an app for the AvePoint Graph API: Sign in to Elements with your account. Go to the Settings page and select API app registration in the Additional area. On the API app registration page, click Create app registration under the Public API tab. In the Basic information step, enter a name for the app and select the corresponding permissions that you need to grant to this app. In the Customer scope step, select All customers, Specific customers, or Customer groups as the scope. In the Certificates and secrets step, configure the credentials. Credentials enable applications to identify themselves to the authentication service when receiving tokens at a web addressable location (using an HTTPS scheme). For a higher level of assurance, we recommend using a certificate (instead of a client secret) as a credential. Follow the instructions below to configure credentials: Select the Certificate tab, and then click Upload certificate to upload a certificate (.cer file). The certificate serves as credentials that allow your application to authenticate itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime. You can refer to Prepare a Certificate to prepare a certificate. Select the Client secret tab, click Add client secret, set the effective duration to 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years, and then click Add to generate a client secret. Client secret values cannot be entirely shown once they are saved. To get a client secret value for later use, copy and save it upon creation. Click Save to save your configurations. When you finish the registration, click the app name and you can copy the generated Application (Client) ID on the App registration details page. Prepare a Certificate To prepare self-signed certificate files based on your scenario, choose one of the following methods. Use a Key Vault in Azure to Prepare Certificates Before preparing a certificate with this method, make sure you have a key vault in Azure. If you have an Azure subscription but do not have any key vaults, refer to the instructions below to create a Key Vault in Azure. Make sure you have an Azure subscription that contains Azure Key Vault. Then follow the instructions below: Create an application. This application is only used for Azure Key Vault. a. In the Microsoft Entra admin center (or Microsoft Azure portal), navigate to Identity > Applications > App registrations (or Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations). b. Click New registration. c. On the Register an application page, configure the application settings. d. Click Register to create your application. e. After the application is created, copy the application ID. Add a client secret for the application. a. After creating the application, click Certificates & secrets in the left menu. b. In the Client secrets field, click New client secret. c. In the Add a client secret pane, enter a description for the client secret and select a duration. d. Click Add. The value of the client secret is automatically generated and displayed. e. Copy the client secret value. You will need to provide the value when configuring the encryption profile. Note: The value will be hidden after you leave or refresh the page. Create a key vault. a. In the Microsoft Azure portal, enter Key vaults in the search box on the top, and then select the first result to access the Key vaults page. b. Click Create. The Create a key vault page appears. c. In the Basics tab, provide the basic information for the key vault, and then click the Access configuration tab. d. In the Access policies section, click Create. e. The Create an access policy pane appears. In the Permissions tab, select the following Key permissions: i. In the Key Management Operations field, select Get. ii. In the Cryptographic Operations field, select Decrypt and Encrypt. f. Click Next to go to the Principal tab. i. In the Principal pane, complete the following steps: ii. Enter the application name or application ID in the search box. iii. Select the application and click Select at the bottom. iv. Click Next at the bottom. g. Click Create to add the access policy. h. Click the Networking tab. i. Select Enable public access which allows all networks to connect to this key vault. j. Click the Tags tab and you can add tags to categorize your key vault. k. Click Review + create to review all of your configurations first, and then click Create at the bottom to create the key vault. Note: If you need to change some settings before creating the key vault, you can click the < Previous button to change previous settings.* Create a key. a. On the Key vaults page, click the newly created key vault. b. Click Keys in Settings. In the Keys pane, click Generate/Import and create a key. c. In the Keys pane, click the key name, and then click the current version. The key properties are displayed. d. Copy the key identifier. You will need to provide the key identifier when configuring the encryption profile. Then, refer to the steps below to prepare the certificate: In the Microsoft Azure portal, navigate to Key vaults. On the Key vaults page, select a key vault and then select Certificates in the left menu. In the Certificates panel, click Generate/Import and complete the required fields. The screenshot below is a sample certificate. (In the Content Type field, select PKCS #12) Click Create and wait for the Status of the certificate to become Enabled. You can click Refresh to update the status if needed. Click the name of the certificate, and then select the current version of the certificate. Click Download in CER format and Download in PFX/PEM format to download the certificate files to your local machine. When you have the certificate (.pfx file), you must set a password to protect the certificate. a. Open Windows PowerShell and paste the following script. Replace [Full path to your PFX] with the full path of the certificate (.pfx file) on your local machine. Note that quotes are required when you enter the commands. $pfxPath=\"[Full path to your PFX]\" Export-PfxCertificate -Password $(Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt \"Enter a password to protect the certificate\") -PFXData $(Get-PfxData -FilePath $pfxPath) -FilePath $pfxPath b. Press Enter to execute the script. Note: The .pfx file contains your private key. Use Windows PowerShell to Prepare Certificates To create a self-signed certificate using Windows PowerShell, refer to the following steps: Note: The steps below are based on running Windows PowerShell on a machine with the Windows 10 or Windows 11 operating system. Right-click Windows PowerShell on the machine and select Run as administrator from the drop-down list. Use the New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet to generate certificate files. For example: $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject CN=AvePointCustomApp -CertStoreLocation 'Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My' -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddMonths(60) Press Enter on the keyboard. Export the .crt (or .cer) file by entering the following command: Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath AvePointCustomApp.crt Note the following: If you want to export a .cer file, replace .crt with .cer in the cmdlet above. The file will be saved to the current working directory of the PowerShell session. To specify a different directory, use the full path, for example: Export-Certificate -Cert $cert -FilePath \"C:\\\\Temp\\\\AvePointCustomApp.crt\" Export the .pfx file with a password by entering the following command: Export-PfxCertificate -Password $(Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt \"Enter a password to protect the certificate\") -Cert $cert -FilePath AvePointCustomApp.pfx Note the following: The .pfx file contains your private key. The file will be saved to the current working directory of the PowerShell session. To specify a different directory, use the full path, for example: Export-PfxCertificate -Password $(Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt \"Enter a password to protect the certificate\") -Cert $cert -FilePath \"C:\\\\Temp\\\\AvePointCustomApp.pfx\" Press Enter on the keyboard. Get the Access Token Based on the credentials of an app registration in Elements, refer to the following sections. Client Secret If you want to get the access token with a client secret in an app registration, follow the instructions below to send a POST request: Set the access token URL: https://identity.avepointonlineservices.com/connect/token. Set the header to Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Set the following parameters in the request body: grant_type – Set this value to client_credentials. client_id – Copy the Application (Client) ID value from the app registration details page and paste the value here. client_secret – Copy the Client Secret value that has been saved upon the creation of the app registration, and paste the value here. In the response: The access_token node represents the token value. The expires_in node represents how many seconds until the token expires. The scope node lists the assigned permissions of the app registration. Certificate Once you have the application (client) ID, get the access token via the application (client) ID to authenticate with Elements APIs. The following information is required to get an access token: Element Description Identity Service URL https://identity.avepointonlineservices.com Application (Client) ID The application (client) ID you have retrieved. Certificate The corresponding .pfx certificate file of the .cer certificate you used when registering the app. To get the access token using the above information, create a JSON web token using the Client ID and certificate first, and then use the JSON web token to request an access token of the defined scope from Identity Service. Below is an example for getting the access token: var identityServiceUrl = \"{https://identity.avepointonlineservices.com}\"; var client = new HttpClient(); var disco = await client.GetDiscoveryDocumentAsync(identityServiceUrl); if (disco.IsError) { return; } var tokenResponse = await client.RequestClientCredentialsTokenAsync(new ClientCredentialsTokenRequest { Address = disco.TokenEndpoint, ClientAssertion = new ClientAssertion() { Type = OidcConstants.ClientAssertionTypes.JwtBearer, Value = CreateClientAuthJwt(disco) } }); if (tokenResponse.IsError) { return; } return tokenResponse.Json; private static string CreateClientAuthJwt(DiscoveryDocumentResponse response) { var clientId = \"{Client ID}\"; var certificateThumbprint = \"{Certificate Thumbprint}\"; // set exp to 5 minutes var tokenHandler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler { TokenLifetimeInMinutes = 60 }; var securityToken = tokenHandler.CreateJwtSecurityToken( // iss must be the client_id of our application issuer: clientId, // aud must be the identity provider (token endpoint) audience: response.TokenEndpoint, // sub must be the client_id of our application subject: new ClaimsIdentity( new List<Claim> { new Claim(\"sub\", clientId), new Claim(\"jti\", Guid.NewGuid().ToString())}), // sign with the private key (using RS256 for IdentityServer) signingCredentials: new SigningCredentials( new X509SecurityKey(new X509Certificate2(LoadCertificate(certificateThumbprint))), \"RS256\") ); return tokenHandler.WriteToken(securityToken); } private static X509Certificate2 LoadCertificate(string certificateThumbprint) { var store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.LocalMachine); store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly); var vCloudCertificate = store.Certificates.Find( X509FindType.FindByThumbprint, certificateThumbprint, false)[0]; return vCloudCertificate; } Note: The token you get will expire in one hour, and you need to get the token again after the expiration."
